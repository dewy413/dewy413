# About me

Hello! My name is Jordan Deuley, but a lot of people known me as Dewy.

I study at Lyon College which is in Batesville, Arkansas. Here is a little bit about [Lyon College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_College).

I am majoring in Computer Science and I will graduate in Spring 2024. In my time here at Lyon I rushed the fraterity Tau Kappa Epsilon.
